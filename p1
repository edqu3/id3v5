It is true that the there are a finite 
amount of disrete value assignments for r_nk,

for example for n = 5 data points split between k = 2 clusters.
There will exist a total of n*k = 10 combinations.



The K-means algorithm will eventually converge[1], because we are reducing the Distortion measure during each iteration, rather we are minimizing the sum of squared distances between the centroid and the sorrounding points. As proven


The distances from the miu_k clusters, 

 after each iteration during 
the M-Step(The calculation of the new centroid, miu_k)

After each iteration of the 





K Means finds the LOCAL MININUM, NOT GLOBAL OPTIMUM.

[1] Converge means that the algorithm will stop due to no new
	reassignments of membership of the points to new clusters.
	As an consequence, Miu_k also does not change, or rather it 
	converges to the "true" mean.







N = 3, K = 2
A	1	3
B	2	4
C	11	33

2^3 = 8

Cluster 0 can have just {}, [A], [B], [C], [AB], [ABC], [AC], [BC]
Cluster 1 can have just {}, [A], [B], [C], [AB], [ABC], [AC], [BC] - 1
